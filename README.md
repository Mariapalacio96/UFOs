In this HTML page the users will be able to find a dynamic table were they can look at the differents sightings that occurred in the us. Tha users will be able to filtered the table in different ways in order to find those sightings that the they are interested on.

## Results
Some people may be interested on the durationa and looking for a specific range of time of the sightings, so we should add that filter as well. As a development for the page, we could gather more information of when did these sightings happen. If they usually happeng at night or daytime.
